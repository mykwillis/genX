Haploid vs. Diploid - the conventional wisdom is that having multiple 
copies of the genome is useful in dynamic environments, but that it has
a negligable effect for static problem solving.

Updated web site with version 0.9.2 based on changelist @17.

Created depot genx1.0, and branches genx_to_genx1.0 and genx1.0_to_genx.

Updated Build project to automate the creation of NDoc and HTML Help 
Workshop help files.  Everything should be completely automated now.

genX1.0 is simplified, and should stay that way.  Gene labeling, reordering,
and so forth should be put in the main branch and shipped as version 2.0.

- Need to create a redistributable merge module so that developers can
  redistribute the genX assembly with their applications.
  
- Need to turn on licensing.

How does an organism decide which allele to express, if more than one is
present?  Turns out Mendel was lucky in that the traits he studied with
pea plants have one dominant and one recessive allele.  But in real life,
incomplete dominance and codominance (not the same thing), exist.

incomplete dominance: black mouse + white mouse = gray mouse. (blended traits)
codomincance: black mouse + white mouse = spotted mouse. (both traits expressed, but not blended.)

AB blood type is an example of codominance.

So to translate this to artificial genetic algorithms, we should allow for
some type of 'blending' of alleles when both are present in an individual.
Just like other operators, we can probably blend differently depending on
the gene itself.

I think people often over-simplify the process by which genes contribute to
morphology.  Environment, both at the cellular level and organism level, probably
play a much larger role in how a trait is expressed than people normally think.

Again, the metaphore: genes set the stage, they set up the pieces of the pinball
machine, etc.  The environment has a big effect on the initial trajectory of an
object through this genetic maze, and can influence it on the way.

Maybe a way to visualize this is that the genes define the placement of walls
in a hyper-maze in very many dimensions.  Consider each trait of an individual
to be represented by one dimension.  Then the genes define...

Polygenic traits, those that depend on multiple genes, are obviously very common.
Alleles can be additive or not.
