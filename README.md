genX Genetic Algorithm Library for .NET (historical)

This library was created sometime around 2002 as part of Wanderlust Software, LLC.

I think it was intended to be a commercial product, though I'm not sure I ever actually
released it.

The code hasn't been touched since about that time, so probably all of the project files
need to be modified to work with modern Visual Studio versions.
