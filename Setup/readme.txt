Where to Start?
---------------
The genX Developer's Guide is the best place to start, and can be accessed 
with the Start menu.  Traverse the Start menu to All Programs, Wanderlust 
Software, genX, and select genX Developer's Guide.

Once you've become familiar with the Developer's Guide, the Class Library 
Reference can be used for details on the properties, methods, and events
defined by genX.  The Class Library Reference can be accessed in the same
Start menu folder as the Developer's Guide.
 
As with most components, you can cut right to the chase and open up the 
sample projects that are installed in the Samples subdirectory of your
genX installation.


Licensing and Redistribution
----------------------------
See the genX Developer's Guide for information on licensing and 
redistribution.


Building the Samples
---------------------
The sample applications each have their own C# project file (.csproj).
Open this project from Visual Studio .NET, and invoke the Build Solution
menu item as normal.
