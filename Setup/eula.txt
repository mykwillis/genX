SOFTWARE PRODUCT LICENSE

The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as by other intellectual property laws and treaties.  The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is licensed to you, not sold. Wanderlust or its suppliers own title, copyright, and other intellectual property rights in the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.

1.  GRANT OF LICENSE. This EULA grants you the following limited, non-exclusive rights, subject to all terms and conditions of this EULA:

You may install the SOFTWARE PRODUCT for use by a single developer on a  computer with a single set of input devices, so long as such computer is used only by one developer (Developer Seat). The component parts of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT may not be distributed to different individual developers. The developer may use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT to design, develop, and test software application components and software application products ("Applications"). You may not network the SOFTWARE and/or otherwise allow it, or any component part of it, to be used by any more than one developer.

The SOFTWARE package includes a unique SOFTWARE PRODUCT SERIAL NUMBER, which allows for the registration of the SOFTWARE. You are expressly NOT GRANTED the right to distribute the SOFTWARE PRODUCT SERIAL NUMBER  in any way. The distribution, of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT SERIAL NUMBER shall constitute a breach of this license, the effect of which shall be the automatic termination and revocation of all the rights granted herein.  

The SOFTWARE is subject to the following restrictions:  

Wanderlust grants you a royalty-free right to reproduce and distribute the SOFTWARE with your Applications provided that you (a) distribute the SOFTWARE only in conjunction with and as a part of your application ("EXE") or as an application component; (b) do not use Wanderlust's name, logo, or trademarks to market your Applications without the express written consent of Wanderlust; (c) include Wanderlust's copyright notice for the SOFTWARE on your product documentation and in the "About Box" of your Applications, ("Portions by Wanderlust.

All Rights Reserved"); (d) agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Wanderlust, its suppliers and resellers, from and against any claims or lawsuits, including attorney's fees that may arise from the use or distribution of your Applications with the SOFTWARE modules; (e) do not distribute, bundle, wrap or subclass the SOFTWARE as a component which, when used in a DESIGNTIME development environment exposes the programmatic interface of the SOFTWARE; (f) use the SOFTWARE to create an Application that is significantly different than the SOFTWARE.  Wanderlust reserves all rights not expressly granted to you in this EULA.

You may create Applications using the SOFTWARE, and you may incorporate in said Applications, those files identified in the accompanying documentation as "redistributable files," in executable form only. This grant shall not apply if such Application is a Web/Internet server application.

The license grant for the components that constitute Wanderlust's Suite are subject to the following additional restrictions:


For Web/Internet server APPLICATIONS, a separate license is required for installing, using or distributing the SOFTWARE or the "redistributable files" on or from a Web/Internet server machine; however, you may distribute or transfer free of royalties the "redistributable files" as client components to client machines.

If you are using an EVALUATION COPY THIS LICENSE IS FURTHER RESTRICTED as follows: You are granted a License to use the SOFTWARE for a period of thirty (30) days counted from the day of installation (the "EVALUATION PERIOD"); and upon completion of the EVALUATION PERIOD, you shall either a) delete the SOFTWARE and the DOCUMENTATION from the computer, or you may b) contact Wanderlust or one of its authorized dealers to purchase a license of the SOFTWARE, which is subject to the terms and limitations contained herein.

The right to use, access or view the SOFTWARE source code is hereby expressly NOT GRANTED to you. All rights not expressly and specifically granted herein are reserved, and remain the property of Wanderlust.
