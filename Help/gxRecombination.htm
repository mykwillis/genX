                Recombination&nbsp;is&nbsp;the method by which genetic information from two or 
                more parent individuals is combined into a single set of genes in their 
                offspring.&nbsp; Recombination is central to the traditional interpretation of 
                genetic algorithms, as it is the process by which good 'chunks' of genes from 
                different individuals&nbsp;are brought together to form a child.
            </P>
            <H4 class="dtH4">Recombination Methods</H4>
            <P>
                There are a very large number of recombination operators that have been 
                described in the world of acadamia, many of them inspired by natural processes, 
                and many that have little biological inspiration.&nbsp; Arguably&nbsp;the 
                simplest method is single-point crossover, in which a new individual is created 
                by first copying each gene in the first parent until it reaches a randomly 
                selected crossover point, and then copying the remaining genes from the second 
                parent.</P>
            <P>Many&nbsp;varieties of crossover-type recombination operators exist, 
                including&nbsp;some that select multiple crossover points, some that restrict 
                the location of potential crossover points, and so on.</P>
            <P>Genetic algorithms have long been used to tackle problems in which the 
                individuals represent a potential solution to an ordering problem, such as a 
                description of cities to visit in the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).&nbsp; 
                The encoding choices that have been used for ordering problems of this nature 
                are problematic for crossover recombination, because it turns out that 
                offspring of individuals encoding ordering problems&nbsp;often do not represent 
                viable solutions.</P>
            <P>To deal with these difficulties, researchers developed special recombination 
                methods that are sure to always produce viable offspring.&nbsp; The most 
                popular is probably Partially Matched Crossover (PMX),&nbsp;which essentially 
                attempts to preserve large chunks of genes in each parent.</P>
            <H4 class="dtH4">Selecting a Recombination Method with genX</H4>
            <P>genX supports the most popular recombination methods, including single-point 
                crossover, PMX, and others.&nbsp; You can choose the recombination method to 
                use by setting the <STRONG>RecombinationMethod</STRONG> property of the&nbsp;GA 
                component.</P>
