            <P>Some terms that are thrown around in selection schemes:</P>
            <P><STRONG>stochastic</STRONG> - probabilistic.&nbsp; In stochastic selection 
                schemes, there is no guarantee made as to whether or not an individual will be 
                allowed to reproduce, there are only probabilities assigned to that occurance.</P>
            <P><STRONG>sampling with replacement</STRONG> - After selecting an individual from 
                the population, that individual is put back in 'the pool' of candidates for the 
                next selection.&nbsp; This means that the probability of an individual being 
                selected is not affected by how many times it has already been chosen.&nbsp;
            </P>
            <P><STRONG>sampling without replacement</STRONG> - After selecting an individual 
                from the population, that individual is not put back in the pool.&nbsp; 
                Actually, it is put back in the pool, but its selection probability is reduced 
                by 1.0.&nbsp; This makes sure that any individual will never have more than f/f<SUB>t</SUB>
                + 1 instances in the next generation.</P>
            <P>&nbsp;</P>
            <P>Deterministic.&nbsp; This method selects individuals according to their expected 
                selection count ( pselect * n ).&nbsp; Each individual is automatically 
                selected at the number of times given by the integer portion of e.&nbsp; The 
                population is then sorted according to the remainders, and the indiviuals with 
                the highest remainders are selected until the desired number has been chosen.</P>
            <P>Remainder Stochastic Sampling Without Replacement.</P>
            <P>Stochastic Sampling with Replacement.&nbsp; This is Roulette Selection.</P>
