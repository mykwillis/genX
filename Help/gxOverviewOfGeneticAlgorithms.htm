            <P>
                Genetic algorithms use a simplified model of&nbsp;biological evolution 
                to&nbsp;search out good solutions&nbsp;to a wide range of problems.&nbsp; This 
                deceptively simple model has been shown to be effective in a wide range of 
                problem domains, making genetic algorithms an important&nbsp;tool&nbsp;in 
                problem solving and optimization.
            </P>
            <H4 class="dtH4">The Basic Framework</H4>
            <P>A genetic algorithm operates by evolving a population of <STRONG>individuals</STRONG>, 
                each of which&nbsp;represents a candidate solution to the problem at 
                hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;An individual has one or more <STRONG>chromosomes</STRONG>, 
                each a string of <STRONG>genes</STRONG> supplying the values of parameters to 
                be used in the candidate solution.&nbsp; As in natural genetics, each&nbsp;of a 
                gene's possible values is called an <STRONG>allele</STRONG> .&nbsp; Using 
                a&nbsp;problem-specific function, the algorithm&nbsp;can decode an 
                individual&nbsp;and determine&nbsp;its <STRONG>fitness</STRONG>,&nbsp;a measure 
                of how well the candidate solution it encodes solves the given problem.</P>
            <P>Each of the individuals in the&nbsp;initial population is assigned a random 
                genome; that is, each of the genes of the initial population of individuals is 
                set to a random allele.&nbsp; The population is then evolved by genetic 
                operators to create new individuals primarily based on existing 
                individuals.&nbsp; In most genetic algorithms, the most important evolution 
                operator is called <STRONG>recombination</STRONG>,&nbsp;which creates new 
                individuals by combining the genetic material of two or more existing 
                individuals.&nbsp; Choosing the parents of&nbsp;each new individual is called <STRONG>
                    selection</STRONG>, and&nbsp;usually involves a&nbsp;stochastic 
                (probabilistic) choice skewed&nbsp;to favor&nbsp;highly-fit individuals.&nbsp; 
                New individuals have a small chance of being <STRONG>mutated</STRONG>, which 
                results in a (typically random) change to the value of one or more of their 
                genes.&nbsp;</P>
            <P>The algorithm continues in this manner, weeding out low-fitness individuals to 
                make room for the new offspring generated by recombination and mutation, until 
                an&nbsp;acceptable solution is found or&nbsp;some other&nbsp;termination 
                criterion is met.&nbsp; There are many possible encodings to use for 
                individuals, and many different operators to use for recombination, selection, 
                and mutation, but a straightforward iterative application of these operators is 
                essentially all there is to the genetic algorithm.</P>
            <P>
                The&nbsp;fundamental premise of the genetic algorithm is that by combining 
                genetic material from "good" individuals, offspring will be created that have a 
                good chance of being "better" than their parents.&nbsp; The fact that this can 
                be shown to be true in a variety of problem domains has fueled considerable 
                interest in genetic algorithms as general problem solvers.</P>
            <H4 class="dtH4">Generality of Genetic Algorithms</H4>
            <P>Note the initially curious fact that the genetic algorithm itself has no 
                knowledge of the problem being optimized.&nbsp; It&nbsp;has knowledge 
                about&nbsp;the "goodness" of each candidate solution in the population (the 
                individual's fitness, supplied by a problem-specific objective function), and 
                it is that information alone that dictates its path through the search 
                space.&nbsp; That&nbsp;the algorithm can be shown to be an effective 
                optimization tool despite its complete generality is remarkable, 
                and&nbsp;argueably its most valuable attribute.&nbsp; Other, 
                problem-specific&nbsp;algorithms exist in many problem domains that perform as 
                well or better than genetic algorithms, but few can rival their robustness and 
                generality.</P>
            <P>Targeting a new problem entails describing the form of candidate solutions to 
                the problem as a genetic template, translating the solution parameters to genes 
                with a specific set of alleles, and supplying an objective function that 
                measures how well a candidate solution solves the problem.&nbsp;
