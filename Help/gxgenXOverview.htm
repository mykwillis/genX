            <P><EM>genX</EM> enables you to build genetic algorithm-based solutions for the 
                Microsoft .NET platform.&nbsp; Inspired by the natural processes of evolution, 
                genetic algorithms excel at&nbsp;quickly finding good 
                solutions&nbsp;to&nbsp;complex problems.&nbsp; By providing efficient 
                implementations of the most powerful&nbsp;variations of genetic 
                algorithms,&nbsp;genX can put the power of genetic algorithms to work on your 
                complex problem, whether it be&nbsp;in optimization, economics, machine 
                learning,&nbsp;or any of countless other domains.
            </P>
            <P>Using genX in your application&nbsp;is as simple as dropping the <EM>genX Genetic 
                    Algorithm Component</EM>&nbsp;onto the design surface in Microsoft Visual 
                Studio .NET, setting a few properties in the Property window, and implementing 
                a single event handler.&nbsp; If you&nbsp;crave more complete control over the 
                process, the extensive genX class library lets you customize and extend 
                virtually any aspect of the algorithm.</P>
            <P>
                This documentation provides an overview of genetic algorithms, their history, 
                and some of their applications.&nbsp; It then demonstrates how to use 
                genX&nbsp;with a number of sample applications.</P>
            <P>It is our hope that you will find genX a valuable tool for solving problems you 
                have today, while also serving as an inspiration for finding new applications 
                for genetic algorithms in the future.&nbsp; Despite the attention they have 
                been paid in academic circles over the past years, many theoretical discoveries 
                pertaining to genetic algorithms have yet to find their way into mainstream 
                computing, and many exciting&nbsp;uses are yet to be discovered.&nbsp;
            </P>
            <P>If you have any comments or suggestions regarding genX, please contact us via 
                email or the web.&nbsp; We're very interested in what you have to say.</P>
