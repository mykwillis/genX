            <P><EM>genX</EM> is licensed on a per-developer&nbsp;basis.&nbsp; Each developer 
                working on&nbsp;a project that uses genX must have a valid license.
            </P>
            <H4 class="dtH4">Evaluation</H4>
            <P>Evaluation versions of genX are available, which provide full functionality of 
                the product.&nbsp; These evaluation versions may be used for 15 days, after 
                which they must be registered or removed from the system.&nbsp; The evaluation 
                version of genX may not be used in any production application.</P>
            <H4 class="dtH4">Pricing and Licensing</H4>
            <P>Licenses must be purchased for each developer working on a project that uses the 
                genX control.&nbsp; A project with 10 people, but where only one developer uses 
                genX at development time, requires 10 licenses.&nbsp; This reflects the fact 
                that the product as a whole is benefiting from the use of genX.</P>
            <P>Retail pricing for a genX developer license can be found on our website&nbsp;at <A href="http://www.wanderlust-software.com">
                    http://www.wanderlust-software.com</A> .&nbsp; Volume discounts for 10 or 
                more licenses are available,&nbsp;as is&nbsp;special pricing for classroom use 
                in schools.&nbsp; genX is generally sold through resellers, who have some 
                flexibility in pricing.</P>
            <H4 class="dtH4">Upgrade Policy</H4>
            <p>
                We may occasionally release maintenance releases that contain bugfixes, 
                optimizations, or other small changes. These releases may be downloaded at no 
                charge by registered users of the same major version of that product for as 
                long as the product is supported.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a new major&nbsp;version of a product is released, registered users of the 
                previous version may download the new version at no charge if their purchase 
                was made within 30 days of the new release.&nbsp; Significant discounts are 
                available for upgrades from versions purchased more than 30 days before the new 
                release.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <H4 class="dtH4">Tech Support</H4>
            <P>We will happily provide unlimited email tech support to registered users for one 
                year from the purchase date, as well as to users in the 15 day evaluation 
                period.&nbsp; Send mail to <A href="mailto:support@wanderlust-software.com">support@wanderlust-software.com</A>.</P>
