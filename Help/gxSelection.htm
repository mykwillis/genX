            <P>Selection is the process by which individuals are chosen to be parents for 
                individuals in the next generation.&nbsp; Selection is normally done so that 
                more highly-fit individuals are chosen as parents more often than less-fit 
                individuals, and this is usually done in a manner that introduces some 
                randomness.</P>
            <P>There are quite a few possible ways to implement selection, and a rather 
                substantial amount of research has been done toward determining which methods 
                are best in various situations.&nbsp;&nbsp;genX provides many of the most 
                popular methods, and even allows custom selection methods to be supplied by 
                you.&nbsp; By default, genX uses something called Roulette selection, which 
                gives individuals a propability of being selected that is proportionate to 
                their relative fitness in the population.</P>
            <P>You can experiment with the effects of different selection methods by setting 
                the <STRONG>SelectionMethod</STRONG> property of the&nbsp;GA component.</P>
