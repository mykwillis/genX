            <P>In order for a genetic algorithm to work on a problem, it's necessary to encode 
                potential solutions to the problem&nbsp;as a genotype.&nbsp; A genotype 
                describes the number of genes in an individual, each gene's type, and 
                constraints for each gene's allele values.&nbsp; In a genotype, each gene 
                usually represents a variable or parameter to&nbsp;be used in evaluating an 
                individual's fitness.</P>
            <P>Consider a problem in which&nbsp;a function f of&nbsp;5 variables is&nbsp;to 
                be&nbsp;maximized.&nbsp; The easiest way to represent this as a genotype to be 
                operated on by the genetic algorithm is as a single chromosome with&nbsp;5 
                genes, each gene having real-valued alleles.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </P>
            <P>Other encodings may be similiarly simple.&nbsp; A knapsack problem, in which the 
                objective is to select items from a set so as to maximize their collective 
                value while keeping their cost below some threshold, may be represented as a 
                chromosome containing one binary gene for each item in the set.&nbsp; In a 
                knapsack problem with 4 items, an individual with allele value 0110 would 
                encode a candidate solution of "select only the second and third items."</P>
            <P>In genX,&nbsp;simple homogeneous genotype encodings (those in which each gene 
                has the same type and allowed values) can be described simply by setting the <STRONG>
                    EncodingType</STRONG> and <STRONG>ChromosomeLength</STRONG> properties of 
                the GA component at design time.&nbsp; genX also supports heterogeneous 
                genotype encodings in which each gene has a potentially different base 
                type.&nbsp; Describing heterogeneous encodings requires a small bit of 
                programming; see the <STRONG>Gene</STRONG> class for a description of 
                this process.</P>
            <P>The samples in the genX package demonstrate a variety of problems and their 
                respective encodings as genotypes.</P>
