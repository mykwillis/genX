            <P>Mutation is a process that alters a gene in an individual, typically by 
                assigning a random allele.&nbsp; Mutation is applied stochastically with a 
                relatively small probability, on the order of 0.001 mutations per gene 
                copy.&nbsp;
            </P>
            <H4 class="dtH4">The Role of Mutation in Genetic Algorithms</H4>
            <P>The role of mutation in evolutionary biology and computing is debated even to 
                this today.&nbsp; While classic texts like Goldberg's see mutation as a way of 
                insuring genetic diversity:</P>
            <BLOCKQUOTE dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
                <P>"Mutation is needed because, even though reproduction and crossover effectively 
                    search and recombine extant notions, occasionally they may become overzealous 
                    and lose some potentially useful genetic material...the mutation operator 
                    protects against such an irrecoverable loss." [Goldberg, pg. 14]</P>
            </BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>There are other contexts in which mutation is seen only as a negative.&nbsp; The 
                "mutational meltdown" is cited as one reason why a small but otherwise stable 
                population of (natural) organisms&nbsp;may be&nbsp;doomed to extinction under 
                certain conditions.&nbsp; Genetic algorithms&nbsp;typically don't allow invalid 
                allele values for offspring - they just throw out the invalid indivual and try 
                again -&nbsp;and so the danger of extinction is not a factor in the GA.&nbsp;</P>
            <P>Finally, there are those contexts in which mutation is seen as being an active 
                and necessary participant in the search for better solutions.&nbsp; Permutation 
                problems such as the Traveling Salesman Problem, for example, often use custom 
                mutation operators with large mutation probabilities for the purpose of 
                reordering the salesman's tour.&nbsp; It may be argued that this is not really 
                mutation, as it deviates so much from the biological inspiration.</P>
            <P>It should be pointed out that if mutation is applied to a population by itself 
                (i.e., without recombination), it results in a random search of the solution 
                space.&nbsp; Obviously, in different circumstances, the randomness it produces 
                can be beneficial or detrimental, and there does not appear to be a good 
                description of what those circumstances are.</P>
            <h4 class="dtH4">Supported Mutation Operators</h4>
            <P>The following mutation operators are supported by genX:</P>
            <DIV class="footer">
                <UL>
                    <LI>
                    Bitwise
                    <LI>
                    Random
                    <LI>
                        Boundary</LI></UL>
            </DIV>
            <P>Bitwise mutation is "bit-flipping," whereby a bit on the chromosome is flipped 
                from 0 to 1 or vice versa.&nbsp; Bitwise mutation may be used with any 
                encoding.</P>
            <P>Random mutation works by replacing one allele in the chromosome with a 
                randomly-selected one from the set of permitted alleles.</P>
            <P>Boundary mutation assigns an allele a value which is either the highest or 
                lowest value allowed according to the constraints.&nbsp; Generally, boundary 
                mutation is useful only when using real-valued genes that have some 
                combinatorial behavior during recombination.&nbsp; For example, when 
                recombination averages the values of each parent's gene when assigning a new 
                gene value.</P>
            <P>&nbsp;</P>
            <P>The mutation operator to use is specified by setting the genX.GA.Mutator 
                property to an appropriate delegate.</P>
            <P>&nbsp;</P>
